    <p class="style1">Restaurant menu design can make or break your restaurant's profits. If your least profitable item is the most prominent on the menu, your guests will order it time and again, instead of considering other options that are equally delicious but more profitable for your business.
         If your food is your art, your menu is your canvas. More on arranging your menu items below.A great menu helps your server upsell, too — by listing out modifiers to menu items, and by making sure to have your side dishes and add-ons listed out where your guests can easily be tempted by them, you create the opportunity for larger check averages. </p>
    <p class="style2">If you're working off of a previous menu, add in your current prices, and then take a step back to analyze them. Put yourself in your customers' shoes. Based on the restaurant sales data in your point of sale system, could you afford to tweak this menu items' price a little bit to make it more appealing? 
        Conversely, if you’ve recently had to increase prices in order to pay your staff better or pay for benefits, use your menu as an opportunity to explain that — language like “thanks to these small increases in menu prices, we’ve been able to pay for all of our team’s health insurance” works great and helps 
        connect your customers to the realities of the staff they love. </p>
    <p class="style3">You could hire a copywriter to come up with menu item descriptions, but the best menu descriptions come from the heart — and right from the source. Consult the chef who created the menu items, think about the story behind each and every meal - the inspiration for its creation, the sourcing of its ingredients, the effort it takes to make - and write down a short description of each menu item on your sheet. 
        Use descriptive and enticing adjectives — like refreshing, crispy, savory, tangy, sour, sweet, crunchy — where possible, but don’t go overboard. 
        Consider what a new customer would be picturing if they’re reading your menu for the first time. What may seem obvious to you might not be so clear to a newcomer. Think about what questions or clarification 
        a guest may need and add those descriptions to your restaurant menu.</p>
    <p class="style4">Printed menus benefit from white space, and the more photos or icons you add, the more distracted customers are from your actual content: the food, and those awesome descriptions you just wrote.
        You may want to include photos of your most profitable menu items, but these photos need to be high quality - and that quality needs to translate to print. You may have to hire a food photographer to take these photos because low-quality photos can be worse than no photos. Work on your food presentation skills first, and then hire a photographer or a friend to take the perfect photo for your menu.  
        If you choose to hire a photographer you can also use those photos on your social media. Make sure to also include a link to your digital menu in your social media bios so users can check out your menus before stepping foot in your restaurant.</p>
